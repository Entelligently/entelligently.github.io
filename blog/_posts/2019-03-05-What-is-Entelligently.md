## Improving comfort and wellbeing.

Entelligently is the platform that connects people to a building. Entelligently puts the occupant front and centre, compared to your usual 'smart building' which takes no notice of the occupant, all the while making so-called smart choices.  Where is the feedback?   Entelligently asks you the occupant direct.  Are you comfortable?

Building Management systems are set once and the contractor then walks away.  No account is taken of the people using the building.  What they are doing there.  What is the weather doing at the time?  As all these elements impact what we wear, how we behave and whether we are in a building in a comfortable state.

By delivering better comfort, Entelligently has the added bonus of increasing wellbeing & reducing energy use too.

## What Problem does Entelligently solve?

Entelligently solves the problem that smart buildings currently have in that they firstly forget about the person residing and working in.  Secondly, the sensor data often has no context from a human perspective.  Entelligently provides that context.   Finally, the building facilities team can fix scenarios by feeding information back to the building's occupant.  How they do this can be through tannoy notifications and flip charts in the foyer.   Not very real-time, responsive, targeted or personalised.

Entelligently, however, provides a personalised prediction of pending comfort and what you as the occupant can do to maintain a comfy, productive and energy efficient workplace.
GDPR is handled with a clear conns notice being presented to the user.  This consent notice is provided by [Consentua](https://consentua.com).   Which means any personal data where the purpose allows this can be processed.

## How does Entelligently work?

The starting point is the easy capture of your comfort.  Within 3-clicks the comfort is captured, the reason why  (too hot) and what you did about it (opened a window).  This regular record of comfort is what builds the intelligence so the system can then start predicting what is the most comfortable range for you personally.
Once the range for each occupant is captured, Entelligently then predicts based on the inbound weather forecast the likelihood of the comfort level being breached.   If this is the case, what can be done to solve this problem?  This is when the smart nudge or 'Snudge' is sent directly to the building occupant.

A particular room or zone can be assigned its own Entelligently identity and the most comfortable setting for that space can be identified based on feedback from those using it.
Entelligently is a cloud-hosted web app.  With a mix of AI services used in the chatbot to help capture your comfort level and in the data analysis that is predicting your future comfort.
Entelligently works best when the people sourced comfort data is matched with sensor and BMS sourced data too. Sensor data on temperature, humidity, light levels, occupancy and CO2 are all very useful data points.   

The BMS is the source of the energy use data as well as being the control centre for changing the environmental settings in the building too.

Entelligently presents the data back to both the end user supplying their comfort data and to building owners and managers.  A series of tailored dashboards are available that show the comfort trend, likely comfort outcomes (prediction) and current comfort score in real-time.
