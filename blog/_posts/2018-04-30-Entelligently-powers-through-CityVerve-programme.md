<p>Entelligently, our energy-optimisation app, is now half-way through the  <a href="https://cityverve.org.uk/">CityVerve</a> programme â€“ the Manchester-based project creating a blueprint for smarter cities worldwide.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.pcsg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/smart-cities-3.jpg" alt="smart cities"></p>
<p>The story behind the app, which was co-developed by PCSG and KnowNow Information, our prompt for developing it and the significant benefits it can bring to organisations, will be outlined in a new article on the CityVerve blog later this week.</p>
<p>Entelligently joined the CityVerve scheme following a fiercely-contested Open Innovation selection day. Eight companies were chosen to receive help progressing their ideas after showcasing their innovative plans to use Internet of Things technology.</p>
