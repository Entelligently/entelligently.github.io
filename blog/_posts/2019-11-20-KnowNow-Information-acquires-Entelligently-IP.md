<em> For immediate release

## KnowNow Information buys rights to Entelligently.

London, 19th November, 2019 - Today, KnowNow Information announces that it has closed the purchase of all IP rights in Entelligently, the workplace environment management solution, from PCSG ltd.

The software solution enables the workplace environment to adapt to ensure the comfort of the workers, improving wellbeing and maintaining productivity. It analyses data from inside and outside the building and compares against comfort feedback the workers provide from their mobile devices. Instructions are then sent to the facility manager, the building management system or directly to the worker on their device.

Developed in partnership by KnowNow Information and PCSG. KnowNow have purchased 100% of the IP for an undisclosed sum and are seeking construction and building management partners across Europe and the United States with immediate effect. 

KnowNow Managing Director, David Patterson, says “A focus on promoting employee wellbeing through the intelligent mediation of office environments also has the potential to dramatically increase worker productivity whilst also helping manage energy consumption. Today’s purchase enables us to form new partnerships with building owners and managers, for both new-build and retrofit.”

The development of Entelligently was part funded through InnovateUK after winning the Energy Game Changer competition in 2017. It has been in trial during 2018/19 by BDP architects, within the Bright Building, Manchester and many other buildings across the UK and Switzerland. Last month it was demonstrated by IBM at the 2019 Festival of Innovation.

### About Entelligently:

Entelligently takes external weather data, internal building data from the building management system, and feedback provided by workers using their mobile devices. It helps to manage the environment by providing instruction back to the facility manager, the building management system, or by providing ‘smart nudges’ to the workers themselves.

Among the measurements used by Entelligently is temperature, humidity, Oxygen levels, Carbon Dioxide levels, brightness, noise and more.

Entelligently is sold as a suite of API’s enabling integration with existing Building Management Systems and Wellbeing applications
